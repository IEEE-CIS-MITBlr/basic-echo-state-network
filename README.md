# Basic Implementation of an ESN on the Mackey-Glass Time Series

This repository provides a simple, step-by-step tutorial on implementing an Echo State Network (ESN) for forecasting the well-known Mackey-Glass time series. The included Jupyter notebook guides you through the entire process, from data generation to final evaluation.

## Features
- **Mackey-Glass Data Generation:** Produce a chaotic time series commonly used as a benchmark in forecasting tasks.
- **ESN Implementation from Scratch:** Learn how ESNs work, including the reservoir concept, spectral radius adjustment, and readout training via ridge regression.
- **Clear Explanations:** The notebook is enriched with Markdown explanations, helping you understand each step.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or above
- `numpy` and `matplotlib` for numerical computations and plotting

You can install all required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
